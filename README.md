A simple Java APP which uses the Twitter API to tweets about a specific hashtag in the last five minutes
and counts how many people are using the hashtag.

Upon starting the application you will see App window open.
It has a inputfield on the top and 2 buttons on the bottom.

In the inputfield type the hastag you want to search, the "#" is not needed and press the serach button.
If the search button is clicked while the searchfield is empty "#IoT" is the default search query.

On a successful search the number of tweets wich contains the hashtag will be shown on the left side 
and on the right side the number of user using the hashtag.
If the searchbutton is clicked again another call will be made, the number of tweets will be updated and 
new user will be added to the usercount.

In case you want to search for new hastag use the clear button to reset the usercount and the inputfield.
